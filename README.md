# URL-Shortener
This is a URL Shortener that build using Cuttly APIs  and requests library in Python. 

A **URL shortener** is a tool that takes a long URL and turns it into a short one that redirects to the intended page. URL shorteners prove to be useful in many cases, such as tracking the number of clicks or requiring the user to only type a small number of characters, as long URLs are difficult to memorize.

We will be using [**Cuttly**](https://cutt.ly/) API to shorten URLs automatically in Python.


Install requests library
==========================
We will need the **requests** library for convenience.
Let's install it: 
- open your terminal and enter below command 
```
pip install requests
```

Get API KEY 
==========================
It is pretty easy to [**create a new account**](https://cutt.ly/register) and use its API in Cuttly. After you signed up for an account, go to **Your account** and click on **Edit Account**:

After that, you'll see your account details, go on and click on the **Change API key** to obtain a new API key (so we can make API requests):
